Planning vacations has never been an easy thing to do, 
especially because it involves a lot of research and decision making.
Fortunately, DestinationBucketList app aims to provide a much easier 
way to plan a holiday, by imposing a platform for users to create 
a personal vacation destinations bucket list while promoting tourism 
and sustainability. (The app will allow users to add vacation destinations 
to their bucket list. Users will also have the option to add public 
items from the list of destinations managed by the admin or create 
new private items. )

The scope of the project is to optimize the process of holidays' organization,
providing objectives such as encouraging tourism and offering sustainable travel 
practices by promoting environmentally friendly vacation destinations. 

The success criteria for this app will be the minimum number of users who sign up 
within the first 2 months being over 1 thousand, the number of destinations added to 
the list, and the overall user satisfaction with the app's functionalities medium 4,5 out of 5.
