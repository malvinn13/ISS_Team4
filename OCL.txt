Invariants:
context PrivateList inv:

	d1.stayDates->overlap(d2.stayDates))
The number of destinations in the list should be between 0 and 100
(inclusive). The same destination cannot be added multiple times in the same
list. The stay dates of destinations in the same private list should not overlap.
context Destination inv:
	self.stayDates->forAll(d1, d2 | (d2-d1).days>=1 and (d2-d1).days<=30)
The difference between stay dates for a destination should be between 0 and
30 days (inclusive). The difference between stay dates for a destination
should be at least 1 day. The rating of a destination should be between 1 and
5 (inclusive).
